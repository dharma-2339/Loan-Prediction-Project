# Loan-Prediction-Project

## OverView

This repository contains a Machine Learning project aimed at predicting whether a customer is eligible for a loan or not. I have implemented three different algorithms for this task: Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting. The goal is to help financial institutions automate their loan approval process, reducing the time and effort required for manual evaluation.


## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to streamline the loan approval process for financial institutions. Manual loan assessment can be time-consuming and error-prone. By building a predictive model, we aim to make the process faster, more efficient, and consistent. This project serves as a demonstration of the power of Machine Learning in solving real-world problems.


## Dataset

Kaggle dataset:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/burak3ergun/loan-data-set/data

I have used a dataset containing various features related to customers, including their income, credit history, loan amount, loan term, and more. The dataset is anonymized and can be found in the data directory. It is divided into two subsets: one for training the models and another for testing their performance.


## Algorithms Used

I implemented the following Machine Learning algorithms for loan prediction:

1. Decision Tree :  Decision Tree is a simple but effective algorithm for classification tasks. It works by partitioning the data into subsets based on the features and constructing a tree-like model for decision-making.

2. Random Forest : Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting.

3. Gradient Boosting : Gradient Boosting is an ensemble method that builds a strong predictive model by combining the predictions of multiple weak models (usually decision trees).


## Results

The results of the model predictions can be found in the project's notebook and source code. I have included metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of each algorithm.
